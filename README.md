# VANET-Simulator
Objective

This project simulates an advanced ad hoc network using a website interface that incorporates features such as vehicle-to-vehicle communication, real-time performance metrics, energy efficiency calculations, and visualization (both 2D and 3D). It is designed to demonstrate the principles of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) and routing in dynamic environments.

Key Features

1. 2D Vehicle Simulation

Vehicles move dynamically on a 2D canvas, simulating real-world mobility in ad hoc networks.

Vehicle positions are updated in real time, showcasing network behavior and interaction.



2. 3D Visualization Using Three.js

A 3D representation of vehicles and their interactions is rendered in real time.

Adds a modern and engaging visual element to the project.



3. Performance Metrics

Tracks important metrics like:

Messages Sent: Number of messages exchanged between vehicles.

Average Latency: Time delay in message delivery.

Total Energy Consumption: Simulated energy usage for all vehicles.


Metrics are dynamically updated on the interface.



4. Energy Efficiency

Calculates energy consumption per vehicle and displays optimized routing energy metrics.



5. User-Friendly Interface

Built with a clean layout using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features an information panel displaying metrics and simulation data in real time.



6. Responsive Design

Ensures compatibility across devices, including mobile, tablet, and desktop platforms.
